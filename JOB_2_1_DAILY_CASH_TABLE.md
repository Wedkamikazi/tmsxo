# JOB 2.1: Daily Cash Management Table Foundation

## 🎯 **WHAT WE'RE DOING**

Creating the comprehensive **Daily Cash Management Table** - the central dashboard that integrates all transaction types (credit, debit, HR, intercompany, investments) into a unified daily view with balance reconciliation and discrepancy detection.

## ✅ **WHAT WE'VE DONE**

**Completed Jobs:**

- ✅ Job 1.1 - Credit Transactions Foundation with reconciliation

- ✅ Event-driven architecture ready for integration

**Available Data Sources:**

- ✅ `CreditTransaction` data with reconciliation status
- ✅ `DailyCashEntry` type definition (from Job 1.1)
- ✅ Bank account balances and transaction data
- ✅ Event system for real-time updates

## 🔄 **WHAT WE'RE IMPLEMENTING**

### **1. Daily Cash Management Service**

- 🔄 **Balance Calculation**:
  - Opening balance (previous day's closing)
  - Cash In aggregation (credit transactions, investment maturities)
  - Cash Out aggregation (debit transactions, HR payments, new investments)
  - Intercompany In/Out totals
  - Projected closing balance calculation
- 🔄 **Discrepancy Detection**: Compare actual vs projected balances
- 🔄 **Verification Workflow**: Daily verification status tracking
- 🔄 **Observations Management**: Notes and discrepancy flagging

### **2. Daily Cash Management UI Component**

**Files:** `src/components/DailyCashManagement.tsx` + `DailyCashManagement.css`

**UI Features to Implement:**

- 🔄 **Interactive Table**: The core daily cash management table
- 🔄 **Date Range Selector**: View historical and projected entries
- 🔄 **Account Filtering**: Multi-account view with consolidation
- 🔄 **Balance Reconciliation**: Actual vs projected comparison
- 🔄 **Discrepancy Highlighting**: Visual alerts for variances

### **3. The Daily Cash Table Structure**

**Table Columns (as specified):**

| Column | Description | Data Source |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Date | Entry date | Generated daily |
| Bank Name | Account bank | Bank account data |
| Account No | Account number | Bank account data |
| Currency | Account currency | Bank account data |
| Opening Balance | Previous day closing | Calculated |
| Cash In (AR/Other) | Credit transactions total | Credit transactions service |
| Cash Out (AP/HR/Other) | Debit transactions total | Debit transactions service |
| Interco In | Inbound intercompany | Intercompany service |
| Interco Out | Outbound intercompany | Intercompany service |
| Time Deposit Out | New investments | Time deposit service |
| Time Deposit In (Matured) | Matured investments | Time deposit service |
| Closing Balance (Actual) | Bank statement balance | Bank transaction data |
| Projected Closing Balance | Calculated balance | Opening + In - Out |
| Discrepancy | Actual - Projected | Calculated |
| Notes/Observations | User notes | User input |
| ⩗ Verified | Verification status | User action |

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Service Architecture**

```typescript
// Generate daily entries for date range
const entries = await dailyCashManagementService.generateDailyCashEntries(dateFrom, dateTo, accountIds);

// Calculate balances with all transaction types
const projectedBalance = openingBalance + cashIn - cashOut + intercoIn - intercoOut - timeDepositOut + timeDepositIn;

// Detect discrepancies
const discrepancy = actualBalance - projectedBalance;

// Update verification status
await dailyCashManagementService.markDayAsVerified(date, accountId, verifiedBy, observations);
```

### **Data Integration Flow**

```text
Daily Cash Service
├── Credit Transactions (Job 1.1) → Cash In
├── Debit Transactions (Job 1.2) → Cash Out
├── HR Payments (Job 1.3) → Cash Out
├── Intercompany (Job 1.4) → Interco In/Out
├── Time Deposits (Job 1.5) → Deposit In/Out
└── Bank Balances → Actual Closing Balance
```

### **Progressive Enhancement Strategy**

- **Phase 1** (Now): Build foundation with Credit Transactions data
- **Phase 2**: Add Debit Transactions when Job 1.2 completes
- **Phase 3**: Add HR Payments when Job 1.3 completes
- **Phase 4**: Add Intercompany when Job 1.4 completes
- **Phase 5**: Add Time Deposits when Job 1.5 completes

## 📋 **IMPLEMENTATION STEPS**

### **Step 1: Service Foundation** *(1.5 hours)*

1. Create `dailyCashManagementService.ts`
2. Implement daily entry generation logic
3. Create balance calculation engine
4. Add discrepancy detection algorithms
5. Implement verification workflow

### **Step 2: Data Integration** *(1 hour)*

1. Integration with Credit Transactions (Job 1.1)
2. Bank balance extraction from existing data
3. Opening/closing balance calculation
4. Projected balance calculation
5. Placeholder integration for future transaction types

### **Step 3: UI Component** *(2 hours)*

1. Create `DailyCashManagement.tsx` component
2. Implement the interactive table with all columns
3. Add date range and account filtering
4. Create discrepancy highlighting
5. Add verification controls and observations

### **Step 4: Advanced Features** *(1 hour)*

1. Drill-down to transaction details
2. Export functionality (Excel/CSV)
3. Real-time updates via event system
4. Responsive design and professional styling

### **Step 5: Integration** *(30 minutes)*

1. Add "Daily Cash Management" tab to DataHub
2. Add events to eventBus for table updates
3. Test build and functionality
4. Verify with existing Credit Transactions data

## 🎯 **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **Functional Requirements:**

- ✅ Generate daily cash entries for any date range
- ✅ Aggregate data from all available transaction sources
- ✅ Calculate projected vs actual balances
- ✅ Detect and highlight discrepancies
- ✅ Daily verification workflow
- ✅ User observations and notes
- ✅ Real-time updates when transaction data changes

### **Technical Requirements:**

- ✅ Clean build with no errors
- ✅ Professional table UI with all specified columns

- ✅ Credit transaction aggregation
- ✅ Discrepancy detection for credits
- ✅ Verification workflow
- ✅ Foundation for all future transaction types

## 📋 **NEXT STEPS AFTER COMPLETION**

**Parallel Development:**

- Continue with Job 1.2 (Debit Transactions)

## 🚀 **READY TO START**

**Dependencies:** ✅ Job 1.1 Complete  
**Estimated Time:** 5-6 hours  
**Impact:** HIGH - Central dashboard for entire cash management system  
**Files to Create:** 2 (service + component)  
**Files to Modify:** 2 (DataHub + eventBus)

*Status: ⏳ HIGH PRIORITY*  
*Next Action: Create dailyCashManagementService.ts*

---

**💡 RECOMMENDATION:** Implement this immediately after Job 1.2 (Debit Transactions) to have both credit and debit data feeding into the table for maximum immediate value.
