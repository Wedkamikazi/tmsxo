## Usage Guide

### Importing Bank Statements

1. **Navigate to DataHub** → Bank Statements tab
2. **Download CSV Template** using the "Download CSV Template" button
3. **Prepare your data** using the template format:
   - Date: YYYY-MM-DD or MM/DD/YYYY format
   - Description: Transaction description
