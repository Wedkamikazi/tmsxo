## Enhanced Cash Management Workflow

### 1. Credit Transactions
- **Extraction & Storage:** Automatically extract credit transactions from bank statements to a dedicated “Credit Transactions” page.
- **Categorization:** Use AI/LLM-based categorization to identify transaction types (e.g., customer payments, refunds).
- **Reconciliation:**  
  - Match transactions with AR Aging and Forecasted Collections.
    - Auto-reconciled entries show a confidence ratio; unmatched entries allow manual reconciliation.
      - Status indicators:  
          - **Matched & Confirmed:** User clicks “Confirm” to clear.
              - **Unknown Collection:** Flagged for manual action.
              - **Verification:**  
                - Each day, a “⩗ Verified” marker indicates the date’s review status.
                - **Observations:**  
                  - Highlight discrepancies if closing balances and transactions do not align.
                  - **Audit Log:**  
                    - Maintain a log of adjustments and imports.

                    ### 2. Debit Transactions
                    - **Extraction & Storage:** Debit transactions stored on a “Debit Transactions” page.
                    - **Categorization:** AI/LLM-based classification (e.g., vendor payments, fees).
                    - **Reconciliation:**  
                      - Match with AP Aging and Forecasted Payments.
                        - Auto/manual reconciliation as above.
                        - **Verification & Observations:**  
                          - Same as credit transactions.

                          ### 3. HR Payments
                          - **Handling:**  
                            - Processed identically to AP, but for employee payments.

                            ### 4. Intercompany Transfers
                            - **Extraction & Storage:**  
                              - Transactions stored on “Intercompany” page.
                              - **Categorization & Reconciliation:**  
                                - Match with intercompany records and cash management forecasts.
                                  - Auto/manual reconciliation, confidence ratios, verification, and observation notes as above.

                                  ### 5. Time Deposits (Investments)
                                  - **Extraction & Storage:**  
                                    - Tracked on “Investments” page.
                                    - **Categorization:**  
                                      - AI/LLM-based identification.
                                      - **Investment Logic:**  
                                        - Suggest time deposits for excess cash above buffer, considering AR/AP aging, forecasts, obligations, and Saudi weekends.
                                          - Ensure liquidity for obligations (e.g., payroll on Tuesdays).
                                          - **Reconciliation:**  
                                            - Match matured investments with bank statement inflows (principal + profit).
                                            - **Verification & Observations:**  
                                              - As above.

                                              ## How This Table Works

                                              - **Automated Data Pull:** Pulls in all relevant transactions from credit, debit, HR, intercompany, and investment modules.
                                              - **Aging & Maturity Logic:**  
                                                - Cash in/out is recognized on the maturity date of AR/AP/Investments.
                                                  - Time deposits are suggested for excess balances, factoring in future obligations and weekends.
                                                  - **Reconciliation:**  
                                                    - Each row/day highlights discrepancies for immediate investigation.
                                                    - **Actionable Insights:**  
                                                      - Notes/observations column flags issues, such as unmatched transactions or missed maturities.
                                                      - **Audit Trail:**  
                                                        - Log of imports, adjustments, and manual interventions.

                                                        1. **Dashboard Integration:** Visualize balances, discrepancies, and upcoming maturities for quick decision-making.
                                                        2. **Automated Alerts:** Notify users of unmatched transactions, maturing investments, or liquidity shortfalls.
